# Overview
This project uses a dataset from Open Data Toronto about Dinesafe to analyze the number of establishments that get pass and conditional pass inspections from 2022 to 2024. By analyzing this, it directly shows how Toronto's health state shows in the food industry, which is highly related to public health. At the end of the paper, the author finds there is a small decrease happening for percentage pass but it is too small to be ignored.

# Dinesafe_Analysis
The repo is structured as follows:

- input/data contains the data from Open Data Toronto clean data, and sketch.

- outputs/paper contains the final paper and reference bibliography file.

- scripts contain the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

# LLM
